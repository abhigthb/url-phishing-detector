A robust, modular Python-based tool for detecting potentially malicious URLs. This hybrid model combines **local heuristic pattern scanning** with real-time threat intelligence from **VirusTotal**, helping to identify both emerging zero-day phishing attempts and established threats.

Built with clean, maintainable code — perfect for cybersecurity enthusiasts, developers, and as a strong portfolio piece demonstrating API integration, modular design, and security thinking.

## Features

- **Heuristic-Based Analysis**  
  Detects modern phishing techniques:  
  • Brand typosquatting (`g00gle.com`, `faceb00k-support.net`)  
  • Raw IP address masking  
  • Suspicious URL length & structure  
  • URL encoding tricks & subdomain abuse

- **Real-Time Global Threat Intelligence**  
  Cross-references URLs against 70+ security vendors via **VirusTotal v3 API**

- **Modular & Extensible Architecture**  
  Clean separation between CLI interface and detection logic — easy to extend, test, or integrate

- **Smart Brand Protection**  
  Safely ignores official domains (`www.google.com`, `login.microsoftonline.com`)  
  Aggressively flags impersonators (`google-secure-login-update.com`, `micros0ft-login.net`)

- **Interactive Command-Line Interface**  
  Quick scanning without needing any GUI

- **Educational & Well-Documented**  
  Detailed code comments explaining both security concepts and implementation choices

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abhigthb/url-phishing-detector.git
   cd url-phishing-detector

2. **Install dependencies**
  ```bash
  pip install requests
  
3. **Add your VirusTotal API key**
  ```bash
  → Go to https://www.virustotal.com/gui/my-apikey
  → Copy your free/public API key
  → Open detector/scanner.py
  → Replace "YOUR_FREE_VIRUSTOTAL_KEY" with your real key



**Security Note:**
Never commit your real API key to GitHub.
Consider using environment variables + python-dotenv in future versions.

**Usage**
python main.py

Enter a URL to scan (or type 'quit' to exit):
> https://fakebank-login-secure.com

 Analyzing...
[Heuristics]
 • Suspicious domain length
 • Potential typosquatting / brand impersonation

[VirusTotal]
 • 7/72 engines flagged this URL as malicious

Verdict: HIGH RISK — Do NOT visit this link!

**How It Works**

Fast local heuristics — zero API calls, instant feedback
URL → VirusTotal hash lookup — privacy-friendly (doesn't send full URL in most cases)
Combines both signals → gives reasoned verdict with explainable red flags
Protects legitimate domains → reduces false positives on real banking / login pages
